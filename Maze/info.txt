We were given a GUI Maze, and we had to write a program to solve this using a breadth first
solution in which we labeled all of the different squares in the maze. We had to utilize our stack and queue
from our previous assignment in conjunction with the linked list we wrote previously. 

Files Given:
GridCell.java
MazeGrid.java
LinearListADT.java
