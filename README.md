# Data Structures + Algorithims
Projects in my data structures and algorithims class.

Some algorithims and data-structures might not be completely optimal
due to the requirements in place of the assignment. For instance a breadth-first
search isn't the best way to solve this maze however we were told to implement
the assignment in this way.
